Webcam mounter on a servomotor connected to an arduino 

Arduino  : waits for input on Serial,9600
Python+opencv : look for a large enough blue object, tells the arduino to move the servo motor left or right so that the blue object stays at the center of the screen

Circuit : servo on ~3 + alim vers servo motor 
+ capacitor
